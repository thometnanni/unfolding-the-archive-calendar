# Unfolding the Archive – Calendar

This project is part of _Unfolding the Archive: New Dimensions of Access to Born-digital Architecture Collections_, led by Ania Molenda at the Nieuwe Instituut. It explores new ways to access and interpret born-digital architecture archives, combining methods from museum studies, archival studies, architecture, and digital humanities. The goal is to develop prototypes and tools that enable dynamic, multimodal, and participatory exploration of digital archival materials, focusing on underused metadata as new forms of discovery.
